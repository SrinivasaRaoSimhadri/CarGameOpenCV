# Hand Gesture Controlled Racing Game

This project demonstrates a simple hand gesture control mechanism for a racing game using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

## Description

The project utilizes hand tracking provided by the MediaPipe library to detect hand gestures. Based on the detected gestures, the program simulates keyboard inputs to control the movement of a virtual vehicle in a racing game.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition for controlling a racing game.
- Simulates keyboard inputs to control the game.
- Supports basic hand gestures for steering left and right.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Installation

https://github.com/SrinivasaRaoSimhadri/HillClimbingOpenCV.git

cd HillClimbingOpenCV

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py


## Usage

1. Run the script `main.py`.
2. Ensure your webcam is properly set up and facing you.
3. Open a racing game.
4. Perform hand gestures to control the game (open palm to steer left, closed fist to steer right).
